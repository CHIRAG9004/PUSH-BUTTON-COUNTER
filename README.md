# discription - During my internship, I worked on designing and implementing a Push Button Counter system, a basic digital electronics project that demonstrates the use of input devices (push buttons) and output displays (LEDs or LCDs) with microcontroller-based logic.

The primary objective of the project was to develop a simple counter system that increments a numerical value each time a button is pressed. The counter value is then displayed on a digital output device, such as a 7-segment display or an LCD screen. This project served as an introduction to embedded systems, signal debouncing, and display interfacing.
